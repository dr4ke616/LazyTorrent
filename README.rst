Lazy Torrent
============

Lazy Torrent is a desktop application that allows you to automatically download
torrents from Pirate Bay. It can be controlled by an Android application which is
soon to be released to Google Play

Lazy Torrent will work with any torrent client, but is integrated directly with
the bit torrent client `Transmission`_.

Lazy Torrent also works with the tor network, so if you live in an area where
your ISP blocks access to the torrent site, using tor will prevent your ISP from detecting your activity.
